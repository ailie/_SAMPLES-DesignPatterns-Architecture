### Files for the Dalvik VM
*.dex


### Java class files
*.class


### Build automation tools
.gradle/
bin/
build/
gen/


### Local configuration files (eg files storing the path to SDK, eclipse per-project personal settings, etc)
local.properties
.settings/


### Proguard folder generated by Eclipse
#proguard/                     # you should not ignore the whole folder, just dump.txt, seeds.txt and usage.txt. Basically, it's a good idea to keep mapping.txt versioned, so that you can later debug obfuscated stack traces from your users; see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html#considerations.


### Personal files
**/Sketch*_tmp.java
